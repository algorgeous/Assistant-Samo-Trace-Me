  Module-ConfigVisuText
=========

This module allows the configuration of the textual description of obsels.By configuration we mean that giving a contextual name and a style for each obsel.


We call the function [Assist.drawTabObsel(obsels)] (https://github.com/fderbel/Assistant-Samo-Trace-Me/blob/master/Module-ConfigVisuText/JS/Assist-Text-JS/Assist-Config.js) after the html page has been loaded.
This function is used to generate the configuration table from the list of obsels (json format) by applying the model for each type of obsel.
The default model is saved in the file [ModelClaco.json] (https://github.com/fderbel/Assistant-Samo-Trace-Me/blob/master/JSON/ModelClaco.json).

If the user changes the configuration, the new model will be generated by the function [Assist.Model.generateModel()](https://github.com/fderbel/Assistant-Samo-Trace-Me/blob/master/Module-ConfigVisuText/JS/Assist-Text-JS/Assist-Model.js) and will be saved in the local storage (data locally Within the user's browser).

## Configuration Interface

The configuration steps are:
  - Selecting the obsel type for which we ask some details
  - Selecting the attributes of this  obsel type
  - Giving a contextual name to the attributes and  obsel type
  - Choosing the color.
